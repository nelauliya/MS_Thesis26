%Include prior work here (i.e. Juan and Akua's)

%----------| 1. CD Santina's 2020 paper, AND Akua+Juan's subsequent traj. gen. paper for it
CD Santina developed a controller built around the most straightforward implementation of PCS \cite{della_santina_model-based_2020}\\
Planar PCC model matched with an \textit{augmented} rigid body model \cite{katzschmann_dynamic_2019}\\
Not 3D, but preliminary results on 3D-fying it available\\
\\
%----------| 2. CD Santina's subsequent 2020 paper on Arc-Length parametrization for PCC
Direct (?) successor to the previous paper \cite{della_santina_improved_2020}\\
Solved the main limitations of the previous model's parametrization\\
New parametrization is based on arc-lengths of a CC segment\\
\\
%----------| 3. F Renda's work on Piece-wise constant strain model
An alternative model \textit{still} using the PCS principles \cite{renda_discrete_2018}\\
Uses PCS to discretize an otherwise continuous (and infinite-dimensional) model\\
Leans much more into the continuum mechanics of soft robots
