%Include prior work here (i.e. Juan and Akua's)
%----------| section  outline |----------%
%----------| 1. CD Santina's 2020 paper, AND Akua+Juan's subsequent traj. gen. paper for it
CD Santina developed a controller built around the most straightforward implementation of PCS\\
Planar PCC model matched with an \textit{augmented} rigid body model\\
Not 3D, but preliminary results on 3D-fying it available\\
\\
%----------| 2. CD Santina's subsequent 2020 paper on Arc-Length parametrization for PCC
Direct (?) successor to the previous paper\\
Solved the main limitations of the previous model's parametrization\\
New parametrization is based on arc-lengths of a CC segment\\
\\
%----------| 3. F Renda's work on Piece-wise constant strain model
An alternative model \textit{still} using the PCS principles\\
Uses PCS to discretize an otherwise continuous (and infinite-dimensional) model\\
Leans much more into the continuum mechanics of soft robots
