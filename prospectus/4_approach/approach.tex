%See notion notes for very rough outline of possible research approach
%----------| section  outline |----------%
%----------| 1. Formulation, augmentation, or selection of a dynamics model
Formulation unlikely\\                                  %<-- WHY! Need to outline and highlight benefits of contemporary models
Rough outline of model assessment;tabulated or other\\  %<-- Outline good-potential models available
Justify model selection based on table assessments\\
\\
%----------| 2. Model validation
Analytically (?) assess model behavior?\\
Motor babble pneumatically-actuated soft robot at hand\\
Simulate output using model, and look at the error\\    %<-- There's probably a discussion to be had about 
                                                        %    the amount of "heavy-lifting" the controller will have to do
\\
%----------| 3. Control development, implementation, and validation
Development of the controller\\     %<-- Simple PID feedback? Other options? SHOULD other options even be considered?
What does hardware implementation look like?\\
What does \textit{validation of}    %<-- Define assessment metrics: error, speed, accuracy, etc.
the hardware implementation look like?
