Materialization of the benefits in dynamic motion--and in safe, compliant interactions with unstructured 
environments--promised by the physical characteristics of soft robots, are largely held back by the lack of 
robust control strategies. Since work has been done to fundamentally develop such control strategies--
particularly for planar motion, a three-dimensional closed-loop dynamic controller for continuous soft robots
emerge as the next frontier in soft robotics controls. This work aims to develop such a control architecture 
of that nature for trajectory tracking, by building on control strategies and dynamic models that have been 
both proven, and validated.
