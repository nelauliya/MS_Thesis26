%Include research/technical background of the topic here (cover Della Santina's work, and also any of Isara's stuff)
%---------| background outline |---------%
%---------| 1. Define what model-based controls is
Model-based controls $\rightarrow$ dependence on the dynamics model\\
\\  %I guess this part might be relatively shorter?
%---------| 2. Model-based vs, learning-based; differences and general dis-/advantages
Model-based\\
$\rightarrow$ (+) meaningful information regarding dynamics and input of system\\
$\rightarrow$ (-) robustness and adaptability may be compromised in more unpredictable settings\\  
Learning-based\\
$\rightarrow$ (+) can achieve higher performance w.r.t. more complex actions\\
$\rightarrow$ (-) computationally more demanding and may sacrifice stability\\
